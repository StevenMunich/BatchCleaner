This is a batch file i use to clean up background processes such as browsers and apps.

to add a background process to the list type

taskkill /F /IM process.exe
to find processes open task manager(cntrl+alt+delete)

I use my own version but have added an "ai generate" one, I use quotes because I truly do not know
if it was AI generated or scrapped. It's not as good. If you use chrome or firefox it may be handy.
